# js_orbital_sim
This is a 3D wireframe n-body orbital mechanics simulator. Runs in real time by default, but speed is adjustable. Works reliably with astronomical distance scales. It also uses the vis-viva equations to calculate orbital parameters and draw elliptical orbit approximations. All of the 3D rendering is done in the code rather than webgl or any libraries, hence the simplistic wireframe models.
